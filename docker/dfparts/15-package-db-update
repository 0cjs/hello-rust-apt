#   Set up and update package database.
#
#   The `apt update` isn't free, so we do it in an early layer and all
#   subsequent layers can assume it's been done. But we need to do a clean
#   rebuild regularly in order to refresh this.
#
#   (Possibly we should be using an ARG here based on the date to ensure
#   it's updated, say, weekly.)

#   Make Debian source packages available, as they're not by default.
