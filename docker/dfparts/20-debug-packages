#   "Debug" packages handy for exploring the container and debugging
#   problems within it.
#
#   Some care has to be taken here because this is used in the "test the
#   package install" container, and so anything here that's an unmarked
#   dependency of the package will not trigger an error as it should.
#
#   XXX Probably we should not be installing any of this at all in the
#   "test package install" container, but for the moment it speeds
#   development to have these exploration/debugging tools available.
